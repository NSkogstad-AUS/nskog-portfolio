    <li>Initalised the directory files</li>
    <li>Asked CODEX to explain the package.json->dev-server.js relation</li>

<p>Through CODEX I learnt we could have a static file server (dev-server.js) serve a folder (public). <br> We use commom MIME types (media types) like text/html, text/css, application/javascript, image/png... etc... <br> We basically have dev-server.js saying "These are the files we're using, Browser" so the Browser knows how to handle</p>
